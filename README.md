In this project, I analyzed a customer churn dataset to uncover key insights and provide actionable recommendations for reducing churn rates and improving customer retention.

🔍 Key insights from the analysis: 1️⃣ The overall churn rate was [insert % here].
2️⃣ Month-to-month contracts had the highest churn rate, indicating the need for retention strategies for these customers.
3️⃣ Customers with shorter tenures and higher monthly charges were more likely to churn.
4️⃣ Payment methods like Electronic Checks showed higher churn rates compared to others.
5️⃣ Customers with fewer service subscriptions churned more frequently, while bundled services improved retention.

📊 Dashboard highlights: I've attached my Power BI dashboard, which provides a detailed visual representation of churn trends, contract types, payment methods, and customer behaviors. It offers actionable insights to help businesses retain their customers.

💡 Recommendations:
